<h1 align="center">ðŸ“Œ Current Version - Alpha v0.4.3 - 08/12/24 ðŸ“Œ</h1>

- **Interface CLI (Command Line Interface):**  
  - For now, the interface is via command line, still in Alpha version.  
- **Alert sounds** added for different situations:  
  - Alert sound when the ship is attacked.  
  - Alert sound when the mining cycle ends.  
  - Alert sound when the total mining cycle ends.  
- **Server shutdown safety:**  
  - The ship stops mining and automatically returns to the station when the server is about to shut down.  
- **Click memorization** implemented:  
  - Improves performance when working together with Tesseract and OCR image recognition.  
- **Button and text recognition by OCR:**  
  - Enhanced detection of buttons and texts in the game interface.  
- **Cargo hold identification in compact mode:**  
  - When reaching maximum capacity, the ship automatically returns to the station.  
- **Automatic pause in non-full screen mode:**  
  - The script pauses automatically if the screen is not in full screen mode.  
  - The script resumes automatically when the screen returns to full screen mode.  
- **In-game behavior:**  
  - Support for mining drones and combat drones.  
  - Identifies if the ship is under attack:  
    - In case of attack, the ship flees to the station and automatically shuts down the script.  
- **Requirements:**  
  - Space station and mining area must be in the same solar system.  
  - Required labels for routes:  
    - `HOMESTATION`: station to store minerals.  
    - `ASTEROIDBELTI` to `ASTEROIDBELTV`: mining areas.
